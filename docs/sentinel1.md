## Dive right in¶

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active imaging technique that records microwave reflections off of Earth’s surface. Unlike passive optical imagers that require cloud-free, sunny days, SAR can operate at night and microwaves penetrate clouds At first glance, a SAR ‘image’ might look a lot like a black-and-white image of the Earth, but these observations contain more than just color values and can be used to query many physical properties and processes!

But before getting into theory and caveats, let’s visualize some data. An easy way to get started with Sentinel-1 SAR over a SnowEx field site is to use the Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) backscatter amplitude data on AWS: (https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-1-rtc-indigo/)[https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-1-rtc-indigo/]
